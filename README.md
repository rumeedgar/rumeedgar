I am Tony Stark. I cannot really prove it, but that's not the point. You should be Tony Stark too.

I am a Software Engineer in my 20s. Although academia is a rotting corpse, I spent some of my time there, so I hold a BSc in Information Technology from [VVU](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1YGTSPeJhDUwjzVWZaqCC2hq1yUpUWs0C6jKRmWBnon4/edit?usp=sharing). I started my "professional" journey in the AI industry, so I have some grasp of machine learning, data analysis, and algorithm development. From 2022 to 2023, I dedicated my time to the so-called "fintech" universe, working on top-secret projects (wink, wink) and later for [Keepup](https://keepup.store/).

Nowadays, I'm a Software Engineer with [Sproutly](https://www.sproutly.africa) (i built this website btw ;)), working on really badass financial solutions for schools and families.

I'm also interested in philosophy, quantum mechanics theories, and books, especially those written by African authors. I'm currently on a goal to read a million books before I depart this simulation called life.
